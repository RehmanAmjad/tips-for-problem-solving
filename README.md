This is an **incomplete** list of all my tips on problem solving. It's far from complete so bookmark it (with the date) to come back later.

# Ray's Tips for Problem Solving

1. Don't bother doing problems that are too easy or too hard. Just do chose slightly outside your comfort zone to improve.
2. It doesn't make sense to solve 20 or so problems from the same category in one sitting. Mix it up a bit.
3. After 20 - 30 minutes of being stuck, look at the first sentence or two until you find a new idea then stop and try to do it again yourself.
