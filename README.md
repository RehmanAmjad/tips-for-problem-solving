This is an **incomplete** list of all my tips on problem solving. Please bookmark it (with the date) to come back later as there is **A LOT** more stuff that I am planning to add to it. 

# Ray's Tips for Problem Solving

1. Don't bother doing problems that are too easy or too hard. Just do chose slightly outside your comfort zone to improve at the fastest rate.
2. It doesn't make sense to solve 20 or so problems from the same category in one sitting. Mix it up a bit.
3. Don’t look at a solution unless you’ve thought about the problem seriously (ie, at least for a day) but know when to give up as there’s only so much a problem can teach you. Never look at solutions too soon because remember that once you have seen someone else’s solution to a problem, then you are deprived, forever, of most of the benefit that could have come from trying it yourself. Even if, ultimately, you get stuck on a particular problem, you derive vastly more benefit from seeing a someone else's solution to a problem which you have already struggled with, than by simply reading a solution to a problem that you’ve given very little thought.
4. Think a little before putting pen to paper - understand questions qualitatively first. Often a good starting point helps massively.
